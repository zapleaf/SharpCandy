# SharpCandy
SharpCandy is a C# Windows IOT Sample for controlling the FadeCandy, a NeoPixel driver with built in dithering, that can be controlled over USB. Sold by <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1689">AdaFruit</a>.

The sample can run several test patterns outlined below.

### Alien Signal
Flashes random patterns of red, green, and blue.

### Fill Down
Fills in all the LEDs one at a time with white, starting at the top and working its way down each column.

### Flash
Randomly flashes the LEDs one at a time in white.

### Flash Trail
Same as Flash except a certain number of LEDs are on at any given time.

### Snake
Suppose to appear like a snake moving around a 8x8 grid. Needs work though as the "head" of the snake often goes back and forth and back tracks too much.

### Stars
The LEDs randomly dim and brighten in white light to mimic twinkling stars.
